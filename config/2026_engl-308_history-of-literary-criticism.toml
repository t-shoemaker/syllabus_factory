title = "History of Literary Criticism"
section = 500

description = """
History of critical thought about art and culture from antiquity to the
present; topics and readings span a variety of eras, approaches, and artistic
genres. Key themes and ideas in criticism may be presented in the context of
historical figures or entire critical movements such as new criticism,
structuralism and poststructuralism, historical materialism, feminism, race and
ethnic studies, and cultural studies, among others.

Our overarching concern will be the problem of representation: What is the
nature of representation? How does it differ from the real? What is it for? How
do we assess what a representation represents? After posing these questions in
the context of classical and renaissance texts, we will make multiple passes
through the last 150 years of critical thought, tracing the dynamics of
representation across art, language, culture, politics, psychic life, and
subjectivity.
