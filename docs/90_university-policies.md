## University Policies

### Attendance Policy

The university views class attendance and participation as an individual
student responsibility. Students are expected to attend class and to complete
all assignments. 

Please refer to [Student Rule 7][rule-7] in its entirety for information about
excused absences, including definitions, and related documentation and
timelines.

### Makeup Work Policy

Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity
or when attendance contributes to a student's grade, for the reasons stated in
Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor. 

Work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not
considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy ([Student Rule
7][rule-7]). 

Please refer to [Student Rule 7][rule-7] in its entirety for information about
makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

"Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may
necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe
for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor" ([Student
Rule 7, Section 7.4.1][rule-7]).

"The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the
student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence" ([Student Rule
7, Section 7.4.2][rule-7]).

Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor
Code and Student Conduct Code. (See [Student Rule 24][rule-24].)

### Academic Integrity Statement and Policy

"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do."

"Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work
submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof
that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep
appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one's work,
should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an
academic misconduct case" ([Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20][rule-20]).

### Civil Rights, Free Speech, and Title XI Policies

Texas A&M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is
safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws
prohibit discrimination and harassment based on an individual's race, color,
sex, (including pregnancy and related conditions), religion, national origin,
age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other legally
protected characteristic. This includes forms of sex-based violence, such as
sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, dating/domestic
violence, and stalking.

learn more about their options for resolving complaints on the [University's
Civil Rights & Title IX webpage][title-ix].

mental health providers) are mandatory reporters, which means that if they
observe, experience or become aware of an incident that they reasonably believe
to be discrimination/harassment alleged to have been committed by or against a
person who was a student or employee at the time of the incident, the employee
must report the incident to the university.

hearings. Currently enrolled students wishing to withhold any or all directory

### Academic Freedom and Classroom Discussion

Academic freedom is a cornerstone of the University. Academic freedom in its
teaching aspect is fundamental to the protection of the rights of the teacher
in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning.

1. Each faculty member is entitled to full freedom in the classroom discussing
   the subject which the faculty member teaches.
2. Texas A&M University will not penalize or discipline members of the faculty
   because of their exercise of academic freedom.
   \
   Along with this freedom comes responsibility. It is the responsibility of
   faculty members to ensure that topics discussed are related to the classroom
   subject. Students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or
   views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters
   of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course
   of study for which they are enrolled.
3. It is not the proper role of the university or any outside agency to attempt
   to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome,
   disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.
4. Engaging with new ideas and perspectives helps students grow intellectually
   and is beneficial to the educational process.
