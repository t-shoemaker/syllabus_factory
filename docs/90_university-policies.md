## University Policies

### Attendance Policy

The university views class attendance and participation as an individual
student responsibility. Students are expected to attend class and to complete
all assignments. 

Please refer to [Student Rule 7][rule-7] in its entirety for information about
excused absences, including definitions, and related documentation and
timelines.

### Makeup Work Policy

Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity
or when attendance contributes to a student's grade, for the reasons stated in
Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor. 

Please refer to [Student Rule 7][rule-7] in its entirety for information about
makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

"Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may
necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe
for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor" ([Student
Rule 7, Section 7.4.1][rule-7]).

"The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the
student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence" ([Student Rule
7, Section 7.4.2][rule-7]).

Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor
Code and Student Conduct Code. (See [Student Rule 24][rule-24].)

### Academic Integrity Statement and Policy

"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do."

"Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work
submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof
that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep
appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one's work,
should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an
academic misconduct case" ([Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20][rule-20]).

### Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy

Texas A&M University is committed to providing equitable access to learning
opportunities for all students. If you experience barriers to your education
due to a disability or think you may have a disability, please contact the
Disability Resources office on your campus (resources listed below)
Disabilities may include, but are not limited to attentional, learning, mental
health, sensory, physical, or chronic health conditions. All students are
encouraged to discuss their disability related needs with Disability Resources
and their instructors as soon as possible.

_Disability Resources is located in the Student Services Building or at (979)

### Title IX and Statements on Limits to Confidentiality

Texas A&M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is
safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws
prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual
assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.

With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university
employees (including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate
assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and must report to
the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of
an incident that meets the following conditions (see [University Rule
08.01.01.M1][u-rule-8]):

+ The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment. 
+ The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at
  the time of the incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2)
  an employee of the University.\

Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes
to their attention – including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a
written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social
media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most instances,
a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how
the report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal
investigation. The University's goal is to make sure you are aware of the range
of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.

Students wishing to discuss concerns related to mental and/or physical health
in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an appointment with
[University Health Services][health-services] or download the [TELUS Health
Student Support app][telus] for 24/7 access to professional counseling in
multiple languages. Walk-in services for urgent, non-emergency needs are
available during normal business hours at University Health Services locations;
call 979.458.4584 for details.

_Students can learn more about filing a report, accessing supportive resources,
and navigating the Title IX investigation and resolution process on the
University's [Title IX webpage][title-ix]._
