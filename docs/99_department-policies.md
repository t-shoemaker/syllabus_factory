### Department Policies

The mission of the University Writing Center (UWC) is to help you develop and
refine the communication skills vital to success in college and beyond. You can
choose to work with a trained UWC peer consultant in person or via web
conference or email. Consultants can help with everything from lab reports to
application essays and at any stage of your process, from brainstorming to
reviewing the final draft. You can also get help with public speaking,
presentations, and group projects. The UWC's main location is on the second
floor of Evans Library; there's also a walk-in location on the second floor of
the Business Library & Collaboration Commons.
